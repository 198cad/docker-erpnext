# ERPNext Docker container

Docker image for ERPNext.

This image was inspired by several other containers developed by the community:
* [emadshaaban92/docker-compose-erpnext](https://github.com/emadshaaban92/docker-compose-erpnext/) / [BizzoTech/docker-erpnext](https://github.com/BizzoTech/docker-erpnext) for the "_simple_" docker-compose setup
* [donysukardi/docker-frappe](https://github.com/donysukardi/docker-frappe) for the alpine variant (actually the source for BizzoTech images)
* [pipech/erpnext-docker-debian](https://github.com/pipech/erpnext-docker-debian) for the complete setup of apps and sites

The concept is the following:
* no need to provide any configuration file: everything will be automatically generated by the container through environnment variables
* the application container sets all the environment variables, the other containers wait for setup to be done
* provide postgresql compatibility

Check base image [Monogramm/docker-frappe](https://github.com/Monogramm/docker-frappe) for details.

Check image [Monogramm/docker-erpnext-ext](https://github.com/Monogramm/docker-erpnext-ext) to see how to expand this image and add custom frappe apps.

:warning: **This image is still in beta and should not be used in production (yet)!**

## How to run this image ?

This image does not contain the database for ERPNext. You need to use either an existing database or a database container.

This image is designed to be used in a micro-service environment using docker-compose. There are basically 2 variants of the image you can choose from: `alpine` or `debian`.

# Running this image with docker-compose

* Select the version closest to what you want in the images folder
    * In the `docker-compose.yml`, you can comment the `build` lines, uncomment the `image` lines and edit versions to download prebuilt docker container.
* Feel free to edit variables defined in `.env` as you see fit.
* Run the docker-compose with `docker-compose up -d` and that's it.
* Now, go to http://localhost:80 to access the first run installation wizard.
